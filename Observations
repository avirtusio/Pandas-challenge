The first trend I observed based on the data was the amount of male players to female players. Male palyers made up over 80% of the player count while female players had roughly 15%. Another observation that was made while coding the data were the age groups. If you were to look at the different age groups and wanted to conduct a particular focus group, the primary focus would be the 20-24 year olds. Most of the players come from this age group and fuel the active users. The last observation is that Final Critic had the largest purchase count along with the highest total purchase value. It led the way for the rest of the item names. These are my three observable trends based upon the data.
